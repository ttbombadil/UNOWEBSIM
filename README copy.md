# Overview

This is an Arduino UNO Simulator web application built with a fullstack TypeScript architecture. The application provides a complete Arduino development environment in the browser, featuring a code editor with syntax highlighting, compilation capabilities, serial monitor functionality, and real-time WebSocket communication for simulating Arduino interactions.

# User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture

**Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool and development server.

**UI Components**: Built with shadcn/ui component library powered by Radix UI primitives, providing a comprehensive set of accessible components including dialogs, dropdowns, forms, and layout components.

**Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a dark theme configuration and CSS variables for consistent theming. Custom fonts include Inter for UI, JetBrains Mono for code, and additional Google Fonts for variety.

**Code Editor**: Monaco Editor integration with custom Arduino C++ syntax highlighting, providing a professional IDE experience with features like syntax coloring, auto-completion, and error highlighting.

**State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management and caching, with custom hooks for WebSocket communication and mobile responsiveness.

**Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing, currently serving a single-page Arduino simulator application.

## Backend Architecture

**Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server framework, built with TypeScript and ES modules.

**API Design**: RESTful API endpoints for sketch management (`/api/sketches`, `/api/compile`) with JSON request/response format.

**WebSocket Integration**: Real-time bidirectional communication for Arduino simulation, handling serial input/output and compilation status updates.

**Development Setup**: Vite middleware integration for hot module replacement and development server proxying.

## Data Storage Solutions

**Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations and schema management.

**Connection**: Neon Database serverless PostgreSQL instance for cloud-hosted data persistence.

**Schema Design**: Sketches table with fields for id, name, content, createdAt, and updatedAt timestamps, with UUID primary keys generated by the database.

**Fallback Storage**: In-memory storage implementation (`MemStorage`) for development and testing, pre-populated with a default blink example sketch.

## Authentication and Authorization

Currently no authentication system is implemented - the application operates with anonymous access to sketches and compilation services.

## External Dependencies

**Database Services**: 
- Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless) for managed PostgreSQL hosting
